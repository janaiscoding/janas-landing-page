# janas-landing-page

In this project, I will be following the Odin's Project template
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)
and create an amazing landing page of my own from scratch!

I will start with the html code. 
Afterwards I will style everything with CSS. 

Notes I took during the project:
- in order to be able to visualize the html code, i added an inline css style of the images to minimize width. 
- Credits to Jack Krzysik and Michał Osiński from Pexels for their beautiful images <3
- funny thing when i wrote closing div instead of opening div in hero section xD jesus christ
- wow, other than the things mentioned here, I found it way easier to make this than I expected!
    it took me 2 hours :D it was awesome. maybe the css isn't beautiful nor pixel perfect, but it's functional for now.


Things I had to Google: 
- The start of the html code :D
- adding links to list items
